Feel free to collaborate. 

As a starter, add your name to this file and figure out to get it pushed to the master repository.

1. Make new branch (name it your name) using git branch -M new_branch_name
2. Make the change
3. Push to your branch
4. File a Pull request (to the master) from your branch (easiest way is on github.com)
5. Accept your Pull Request through Dot-Slash

Run the site using python3 or node
python3 -m http.server
The above line uses the python module http.server.
