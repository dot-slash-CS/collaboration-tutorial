Feel free to collaborate. 

As a starter, add your name to this file and figure out to get it pushed to the master repository.

1. Make new branch (name it your name)
2. Make the change
3. Push to your branch
4. File a Pull request (to the master) from your branch (easiest way is on github.com)
5. Accept your Pull Request through Dot-Slash

Run the site using python3 or node
python3 -m http.server
The above line uses the python module http.server.
